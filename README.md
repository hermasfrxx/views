### What is `views`

- Display page views dynamically now.
- Easy to set up and use by anyone.

> We identify your unique identity through cache, referer and others, and return a dynamic SVG element.
> In addition, `views` also provides custom SVG styles, for more information, see the [documentation](https://views-docs.unix.bio).

For performance and cost reasons,`views` can only be displayed **on your own website**,
it can't work in GitHub(README.md) NPM or other places. You can also donate this project to help me do better.
